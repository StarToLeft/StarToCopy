# StarToCopy

This is my first github repository. The project contains a nodejs socket server and html files for a copy/paste site.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

For StarToCopy you will need the following:

```
Node.js enviroment
Npm installed
Basic knowledge about javascript and web development in general
```

### Installing

It's finally time to install this piece of tech!

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Step 1:
Create a new directory with the name of "StarToCopy" and cd into it.
```
$ cd C:\Users\NAME\LOCATION\StarToCopy
```

Step 2:
It's now time to clone the repository. Use the following command
```
$ git clone https://github.com/StarToLeft/StarToCopy
```

Step 3:
At this step you will need npm installed. Use the following command to install all required dependencys.

*If this step fails please scroll down to "Built With" and use "npm i DEPENDENCY-NAME"*
```
$ npm i
```

Step 4:
Now use the following commands to cd into the server folder and start the server.
```
$ cd ./server
$ node app.js
```

Step 5:
Time to open the page in your browser, go into your file explorer and find the "client" directory.
Open it up and dubble click the index.html file.

## Deployment

Deployment into a live website is pretty simple.
All you will need is a domain directed to the index.html file. I will not go into
detail on how to do this, I do recommend searching up how to put websites and node.js
apps into live scalable commercial projects.
